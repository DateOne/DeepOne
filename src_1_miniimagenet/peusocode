for epochs:
	get tr_batches
	get val_batches
	get t_batches
	for tr_batches:
		get the tr_batch gradients
		train with the tr_batch
		for val_batches:
			complement the val_batch
			calculate the val_batch gradient
			calculate the value of the tr_batch to this val_batch
			add (or not) the tr_batch gradient to val_memory
		for t_batches:
			complement the t_batch
			calculate the t_batch gradient
			calculate the value of the tr_batch to this t_batch
			add (or not) the tr_batch gradient to t_memory
	for val_batches:
		change the model by val_memory
		validate with the model and the val_batch
for t_batches:
	change the model by t_memory
	test with the model and the t_batch


advanced thoughts:
you could also alter models in training, so that (at least) your log of training losses and accs means something.


three problems not solved:

relationship
get model
non-random sampler
